# PSWriteline

PSWriteline is a PowerShell module that brings more editor-like features to PSReadline using through key handlers.

This project is at a very early stage, expect a lot of bugs and a lot of breaking changes.  For right now this is mainly serves as my personal PSReadline setup, but feel free to try it out, open issues, etc.

## Current Features

- Bind Hotstrings (similar to AutoHotkey)
- Command Palette (similar to VSCode)
- Add unbound key handlers for use in the command palette
- Various changes/fixes to Vi bindings

## Planned Features

- Editor mode that treats the input buffer like a text document for quick edits in remote sessions without installing anything on the host.
